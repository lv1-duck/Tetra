# Tetra

**Tetra** is a cross-platform PDF utility built with Python and Kivy. It offers a minimal, user-friendly interface for selecting, viewing, and merging PDF files; Designed to run on both desktops and mobile devices.

This project relies on a diverse set of open-source Python libraries to support cross-platform development, particularly targeting Android via Kivy and Buildozer. The core UI framework is Kivy (2.3.1) for creating mobile interfaces. Buildozer, along with python-for-android, handles packaging for Android deployment. PDF processing is done through PyMuPDF (fitz), which allows fast manipulation and rendering of PDF files without requiring external dependencies. Pillow is used for image handling, while Plyer bridges access to platform-native features like storage permissions and access on mobile devices. 

This is more of a proof-of-concept thing‚Äîa prototype, and it is only made for fun and learning purposes with no plans of ever scaling. But this project is still in active development. Feedbacks and contributions are greatly appreciated.
